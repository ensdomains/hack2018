### What about the weekend hackathon?

By joining the workshop, you are automatically allocated a spot at our hackathon(if you are not planning to come to hackathon, please email me so that I can adjust the hackathon registration number).

If you would like your friends/colleagues to join the hackathon, please redirect them to our hackathon registration page.

http://enshack.noblockno.party

It's a smart contract based registration site where you pay a small deposit (0.02ETH) when you RSVP. You lose your deposit if you do not turn up. You will be able to withdraw your deposit back + we split the deposit of whom did not turn up. The intention is to prevent no-shows. Feel free to RSVP if you want to bet for the chance of getting small extra ETH. If you do, please let me know so that I can adjust the registration number.

### Where should we book my accommodation?

The event takes place at King's College London campus and the closest tube stations are Temple (District/Circle line), Holborn (Central/Picadilly line) or Embankment (Bakerloo/Northern/District/Circle).

The area of the venue is relatively pricey so you may choose to stay in the area where the above tube lines pass. East/South London is relatively cheaper than North/Central/West London in general.

### Are you live streaming?

We will try our best.
